Overview of DNX sale\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        DNX is required for proper operation and comprehensive utilization of\n        Denex (as defined in the docs (the &ldquo;Docs&rdquo;) provided at\n        https://denex.exchange (the &ldquo;Website&rdquo;) as of the date the\n        Purchaser acquires DNX token). After the DNX sale, each DNX is backed by\n        nothing. To the extent they do not contradict these Terms, the rights\n        connected to DNX are subject to the limitations set out in the Docs, but\n        this should in no case create obligations for the Company in addition to\n        the ones contained in these Terms. The company shall have the right to\n        sell any received assets at any point in time.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        The maximum total amount of DNXs to be issued is 1,000,000,000. DNX is\n        minted ahead of the pre-sale, and upon deployment the contract will not\n        permit additional minting of DNX. Ownership of DNX during the DNX token\n        sale carries no rights expressed or implied. Purchases of DNX are\n        non-refundable.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        The anticipated distribution of the DNX tokens is as follows:\n        <br />\n        ●&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;20% Denex Team (3 year vesting);\n        <br />\n        ●&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;20% Future Partnerships &amp; Employees;\n        <br />\n        ●&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1% Promotional Activities;\n        <br />\n        ●&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;49% Community Pool (3 year vesting);\n        <br />\n        ●&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;10% Token Sale Participants;\n        <br />\n        3. DNX Price\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Purchasers in the DNX token sale will be allocated their DNX tokens in\n        exchange for ETH at the following rate:\n        <br />\n        ●&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The first 25,000,000 DNX tokens: US$ 0.008 per DNX\n        token;\n        <br />\n        ●&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The next 45,000,000 DNX tokens: US $0.016 per DNX\n        token;\n        <br />\n        ●&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The next 20,000,000 DNX tokens: US $0.04 per DNX\n        token;\n        <br />\n        ●&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The final 10,000,000 DNX tokens: US$ 0.08 per DNX\n        token;\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        The US Dollars to ETH exchange rate is used to dynamically set the ETH\n        to DNX rate. As a result, for the duration of the DNX sale, the price to\n        purchase a DNX will be set as an amount in ETH.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Purchaser must have an Ethereum wallet that supports the ERC-20 token\n        standard in order to receive any DNX purchased from the Company.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        4.

In the spirit of openness, the\n        Company will constantly update on the Website the number of tokens sold\n        as well as the share of DNX tokens allocated to the shareholders of\n        Company. Furthermore, the Ethereum accounts used to store ETH during the\n        DNX sale duration will publically available and their balances will also\n        be made available.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        5. After the DNX Token Sale\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        The Purchasers should have no expectation of influence over governance\n        of the Company.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Prior to a Purchaser selling DNX after the DNX token sale completion,\n        such Purchaser shall ensure that the buyer of any such DNX undertakes to\n        comply with all the provisions of these Terms as if such person were a\n        Purchaser in the DNX token sale.\n        <br />\n        6.

All purchases of DNX are final\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        ALL PURCHASES OF DNX ARE FINAL. PURCHASES OF DNX ARE NON-REFUNDABLE. BY\n        PURCHASING DNX, THE PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR\n        ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS OR SHAREHOLDERS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE\n        A REFUND FOR ANY REASON.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        IF THE COMPANY BELIEVES, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, THAT ANY INDIVIDUALS OR\n        ENTITIES OWNING DNX CREATES MATERIAL REGULATORY OR OTHER LEGAL RISKS OR\n        ADVERSE EFFECTS FOR THE COMPANY AND/OR DNX, THE COMPANY RESERVES THE\n        RIGHT TO: (A) BUY ALL DNX FROM SUCH DNX OWNERS AT THE THEN-EXISTING\n        MARKET PRICE AND/OR (B) SELL ALL CRYPTOCURRENCY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        8. Taxation of DNX and Taxation Related to the Token Sale\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        The Purchaser bears the sole responsibility to determine if the purchase\n        of DNX with ETH or the potential appreciation or depreciation in the\n        value of DNX over time has tax implications for the Purchaser in the\n        Purchaser's home jurisdiction. By purchasing DNX, and to the extent\n        permitted by law, the Purchaser agrees not to hold any of the Company,\n        its affiliates, shareholders, director, or advisors liable for any tax\n        liability associated with or arising from the purchase of DNX.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        9.

Severability\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        The Purchaser and the Company agree that if any portion of these Terms\n        is found illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part, such provision\n        shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective solely to the extent of\n        such determination of invalidity or unenforceability without affecting\n        the validity or enforceability thereof in any other manner or\n        jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of the\n        Terms, which shall continue to be in full force and effect.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        15. No Waiver\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        The failure of the Company to require or enforce strict performance by\n        the Purchaser of any provision of these Terms or the Company&rsquo;s\n        failure to exercise any right under these Terms shall not be construed\n        as a waiver or relinquishment of the Company's right to assert or rely\n        upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance. The\n        express waiver by the Company of any provision, condition, or\n        requirement of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of any future\n        obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement.\n        Except as expressly and specifically set forth in these Terms, no\n        representations, statements, consents, waivers, or other acts or\n        omissions by the Denex Team shall be deemed a modification of these\n        Terms nor be legally binding.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        16. Updates to the Terms\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        The Company reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change,\n        modify, add, or remove portions of the Terms at any time during the sale\n        by posting the amended Terms on the Website. Any Purchaser will be\n        deemed to have accepted such changes by purchasing DNX or holding DNX.\n        The Terms may not be otherwise amended except by express consent of both\n        the Purchaser and the Company.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        17. Cooperation with Legal Authorities\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        The Company will cooperate with all law enforcement enquiries,\n        subpoenas, or requests provided they are fully supported and documented\n        by the law in the relevant jurisdictions.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        18. Indemnification\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify,\n        defend and hold harmless the Denex Team from and against all claims,\n        demands, actions, damages, losses, costs and expenses (including\n        attorneys&rsquo; fees) that arise from or relate to: (i) your purchase\n        or use of DNX; (ii) your responsibilities or obligations under these\n        Terms; (iii) your violation of these Terms; or (iv) your violation of\n        any rights of any other person or entity.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        The Company reserves the right to exercise sole control over the\n        defense, at your expense, of any claim subject to indemnification under\n        this Section 18. This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of,\n        any other indemnities set forth in a written agreement between you and\n        the Company.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        19. Security\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        You are responsible for implementing reasonable measures for securing\n        the wallet, vault or other storage mechanism you use to receive and hold\n        DNX purchased from the Company, including any requisite private key(s)\n        or other credentials necessary to access such storage mechanism(s). If\n        your private key(s) or other access credentials are lost, you may lose\n        access to your Tokens. The Company is not responsible for any losses,\n        costs or expenses relating to lost access credentials.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        20. Language\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Currently, only English versions of any Denex's communications are\n        considered official. The English version shall prevail in case of\n        differences in translation.\n        <br />\n        21. Governing Law\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        The Terms, the arbitration clause contained in them, and all\n        non-contractual obligations arising in any way whatsoever out of or in\n        connection with these Terms are governed by, construed, and take effect\n        in accordance with Canadian law.\n        <br />\n        22. Arbitration\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Any dispute or difference arising out of or in connection with these\n        Terms or the legal relationships established by these Terms, including\n        any question regarding its existence, validity or termination\n        (&ldquo;Dispute&rdquo;), shall be referred to and finally resolved by\n        arbitration under the LCIA Rules which will be deemed to be incorporated\n        by reference into this clause, save for any waiver of any rights the\n        parties would otherwise have to any form of appeal or recourse to a\n        court of law or other judicial authority, which rights are expressly\n        reserved. The number of arbitrators shall be three. The seat of the\n        arbitration shall be Toronto, Canada. The language of the arbitration\n        shall be English.\n        <br />\n        <br />A dispute arising out of or related to these Terms is personal to\n        you and the Company and will be resolved solely through individual\n        arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action\n        or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class\n        arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a\n        Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of\n        individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other\n        type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration,\n        or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        ANNEX A<br />\n        DNX Risks\n        <br />\n        By purchasing, owning, and using DNX, you expressly acknowledge and\n        assume the following risks:\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        1. Risk of Losing Access to DNX Due to Loss of Private Key(s), Custodial\n        Error or Purchaser Error\n        <br />\n        <br />A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to\n        control and dispose of DNX stored in your digital wallet or vault.\n        Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your\n        digital wallet or vault storing DNX will result in loss of such DNX.\n        Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s),\n        including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet\n        service you use, may be able to misappropriate your DNX. Any errors or\n        malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital wallet or\n        vault you choose to receive and store DNX in, including your own failure\n        to properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, may also\n        result in the loss of your DNX. Additionally, your failure to follow\n        proper procedures for buying and selling ERC-20 tokens, including, for\n        instance, if you provide the wrong address for the receiving DNX, or\n        provide an address that is not ERC-20 compatible, may result in the loss\n        of your Tokens.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        2. Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Because DNX and the Denex platform are initially built on the Ethereum\n        protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum\n        protocol may have a material adverse effect on the platform or DNX.\n        Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the\n        development of quantum computing, could present risks to the DNX and the\n        platform, including the utility of the DNX for obtaining services, by\n        rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that\n        underpins the Ethereum protocol.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        3. Risk of Mining Attacks\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the Ethereum\n        protocol, DNX are susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of\n        validating DNX transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, including, but\n        not limited, to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and\n        selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the\n        platform and DNX, including, but not limited to, accurate execution and\n        recording of transactions involving DNX.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        4. Risk of Hacking and Security Weaknesses\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to\n        interfere with the platform or DNX in a variety of ways, including, but\n        not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks,\n        consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing, and spoofing.\n        Furthermore, because the platform is based on open-source software,\n        there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Company team may\n        intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core\n        infrastructure of the platform, which could negatively affect the\n        platform and DNX, including the utility of DNX for obtaining services.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        5. Risks Associated with Markets for DNX\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        If secondary trading of Tokens is facilitated by third party exchanges,\n        such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no\n        regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or\n        manipulation. Furthermore, to the extent that third-parties do ascribe\n        an external exchange value to DNX (e.g., as denominated in a digital or\n        fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        6. Risk of Uninsured Losses\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions,\n        DNX are uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to\n        insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there\n        is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by Company, to offer\n        recourse to you.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        7. Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        The regulatory status of DNX and distributed ledger technology is\n        unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict\n        how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with\n        respect to such technology and its applications, including the Denex\n        platform and DNX. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether\n        legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and\n        regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications,\n        including the platform and DNX. Regulatory actions could negatively\n        impact the platform and DNX in various ways, including, for purposes of\n        illustration only, through a determination that the purchase, sale and\n        delivery of DNX constitutes unlawful activity or that DNX are a\n        regulated instrument that require registration or licensing of those\n        instruments or some or all of the parties involved in the purchase, sale\n        and delivery thereof. The Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction\n        in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation,\n        make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially\n        undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in\n        such jurisdiction.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        8. Risks Arising from Taxation\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        The tax characterization of DNX is uncertain. You must seek your own tax\n        advice in connection with purchasing DNX, which may result in adverse\n        tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes, income taxes and\n        tax reporting requirements.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        9. Risk of Competing platforms\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        It is possible that alternative platforms could be established that\n        utilize the same open source code and protocol underlying the platform\n        and attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the\n        Denex services.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        10. Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Because DNX confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the\n        Denex platform or the Company, all decisions involving the\n        Company&rsquo;s products or services within the platform or the Company\n        itself will be made by the Company at its sole discretion. These\n        decisions could adversely affect the platform and the utility of any DNX\n        you own, including their utility for obtaining services.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        11. Unanticipated Risks\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Cryptographic tokens such as DNX are a new and untested technology. In\n        addition to the risks included in this Annex A of these Terms, there are\n        other risks associated with your purchase, possession and use of DNX,\n        including unanticipated risks. Such risks may further materialize as\n        unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed in this\n        Annex A of these Terms.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Further Information\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        For further information regarding the DNX sale, please contact\n        info@Denex.com.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        PRIVACY POLICY\n        <br />\n        Denex, (&rdquo;We&rdquo;) are committed to protecting and respecting\n        your privacy.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        This policy (together with our terms of use available at\n        https://denex.exchange (&ldquo;Website&rdquo;) and any other documents\n        referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we\n        collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.\n        Please read the following carefully to understand our views and\n        practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.
