Risk of Losing Access to DNX Due to Loss of Private Key(s), Custodial Error or Purchaser Error",Object(r.jsx)("br",{}),Object(r.jsx)("br",{}),"A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of DNX stored in your digital wallet or vault.

Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service you use, may be able to misappropriate your DNX. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital wallet or vault you choose to receive and store DNX in, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of your DNX. Additionally, your failure to follow proper procedures for buying and selling ERC-20 tokens, including, for instance, if you provide the wrong address for the receiving DNX, or provide an address that is not ERC-20 compatible, may result in the loss of your Tokens.",Object(r.jsx)("br",{}),Object(r.jsx)("br",{}),"2. Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol",Object(r.jsx)("br",{}),Object(r.jsx)("br",{}),"Because DNX and the Denex platform are initially built on the Ethereum protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum protocol may have a material adverse effect on the platform or DNX.

Risk of Mining Attacks",Object(r.jsx)("br",{}),Object(r.jsx)("br",{}),"As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the Ethereum protocol, DNX are susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating DNX transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, including, but not limited, to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and selfish-mining attacks.

Risk of Hacking and Security Weaknesses",Object(r.jsx)("br",{}),Object(r.jsx)("br",{}),"Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the platform or DNX in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing, and spoofing. Furthermore, because the platform is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Company team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of the platform, which could negatively affect the platform and DNX, including the utility of DNX for obtaining services.",Object(r.jsx)("br",{}),Object(r.jsx)("br",{}),"5. Risks Associated with Markets for DNX",Object(r.jsx)("br",{}),Object(r.jsx)("br",{}),"If secondary trading of Tokens is facilitated by third party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation. Furthermore, to the extent that third-parties do ascribe an external exchange value to DNX (e.g., as denominated in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile.",Object(r.jsx)("br",{}),Object(r.jsx)("br",{}),"6. Risk of Uninsured Losses",Object(r.jsx)("br",{}),Object(r.jsx)("br",{}),"Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, DNX are uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them.

It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the platform and DNX. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the platform and DNX in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that the purchase, sale and delivery of DNX constitutes unlawful activity or that DNX are a regulated instrument that require registration or licensing of those instruments or some or all of the parties involved in the purchase, sale and delivery thereof.
