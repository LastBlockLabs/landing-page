        other action or transaction related to DNX has tax implications.
        <br />
        2. Overview of DNX sale
        <br />
        <br />
        DNX is required for proper operation and comprehensive utilization of
        Denex (as defined in the docs (the &ldquo;Docs&rdquo;) provided at
        https://denex.exchange (the &ldquo;Website&rdquo;) as of the date the
        Purchaser acquires DNX token). After the DNX sale, each DNX is backed by
        nothing. To the extent they do not contradict these Terms, the rights
        connected to DNX are subject to the limitations set out in the Docs, but
        this should in no case create obligations for the Company in addition to
        the ones contained in these Terms. The company shall have the right to
        sell any received assets at any point in time.
        <br />
        <br />
        The maximum total amount of DNXs to be issued is 1,000,000,000. DNX is
        minted ahead of the pre-sale, and upon deployment the contract will not
        permit additional minting of DNX. Ownership of DNX during the DNX token
        sale carries no rights expressed or implied. Purchases of DNX are
        non-refundable.
        <br />
        <br />
        The anticipated distribution of the DNX tokens is as follows:
        <br />
        ●&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;20% Denex Team (3 year vesting);
        <br />
        ●&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;20% Future Partnerships &amp; Employees;
        <br />
        ●&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1% Promotional Activities;
        <br />
        ●&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;49% Community Pool (3 year vesting);
        <br />
        ●&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;10% Token Sale Participants;
        <br />
        3. DNX Price
        <br />
        <br />
        Purchasers in the DNX token sale will be allocated their DNX tokens in
        exchange for ETH at the following rate:
        <br />
        ●&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The first 25,000,000 DNX tokens: US$ 0.008 per DNX
        token;
        <br />
        ●&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The next 45,000,000 DNX tokens: US $0.016 per DNX
        token;
        <br />
        ●&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The next 20,000,000 DNX tokens: US $0.04 per DNX
        token;
        <br />
        ●&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The final 10,000,000 DNX tokens: US$ 0.08 per DNX
        token;
        <br />
        <br />
        The US Dollars to ETH exchange rate is used to dynamically set the ETH
        to DNX rate. As a result, for the duration of the DNX sale, the price to
        purchase a DNX will be set as an amount in ETH.
        <br />
        <br />
        Purchaser must have an Ethereum wallet that supports the ERC-20 token
        standard in order to receive any DNX purchased from the Company.
        <br />
        <br />
        4. Timing of DNX Token Sale

        The Company reserves the right to change the sale dates or extend the
        sale duration for any reason, including the unavailability of the
        Website or other unforeseen security or procedural issues.
        <br />
        <br />
        The general public will be able to see the total number of DNX tokens
        currently sold, as well as the distribution of all DNX tokens between
        the participating Ethereum accounts. In the spirit of openness, the
        Company will constantly update on the Website the number of tokens sold

        <br />
        <br />
        Prior to a Purchaser selling DNX after the DNX token sale completion,
        such Purchaser shall ensure that the buyer of any such DNX undertakes to

        IF THE COMPANY BELIEVES, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, THAT ANY INDIVIDUALS OR
        ENTITIES OWNING DNX CREATES MATERIAL REGULATORY OR OTHER LEGAL RISKS OR
        ADVERSE EFFECTS FOR THE COMPANY AND/OR DNX, THE COMPANY RESERVES THE

        MARKET PRICE AND/OR (B) SELL ALL CRYPTOCURRENCY ASSETS OF THE COMPANY.
        <br />
        <br />
        8. Taxation of DNX and Taxation Related to the Token Sale
        <br />
        <br />
        The Purchaser bears the sole responsibility to determine if the purchase
        of DNX with ETH or the potential appreciation or depreciation in the
        value of DNX over time has tax implications for the Purchaser in the
        Purchaser's home jurisdiction. By purchasing DNX, and to the extent
        permitted by law, the Purchaser agrees not to hold any of the Company,
        its affiliates, shareholders, director, or advisors liable for any tax

        <br />

        PERMITTED BY ANY APPLICABLE LAW, THE DISCLAIMERS OF LIABILITY CONTAINED
        HEREIN APPLY TO ANY AND ALL DAMAGES OR INJURY WHATSOEVER CAUSED BY OR
        RELATED TO (i) USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, DNX OR (ii) THE DENEX TEAM

        <br />

        the Company with respect to the purchase and sale of DNX. For facts
        relating to the sale and purchase, the Purchaser agrees to rely only on
        the Terms in determining purchase decisions and understands that the
        Terms govern the sale of DNX and supersede any public statements about
        the DNX token sale made by third parties or by the Denex Team or
        individuals associated with any of the Denex Team, past and present and
        during the DNX token sale.
        <br />
        <br />
        14. Severability
        <br />
        <br />
        The Purchaser and the Company agree that if any portion of these Terms
        is found illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part, such provision
        shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective solely to the extent of
        such determination of invalidity or unenforceability without affecting
        the validity or enforceability thereof in any other manner or
        jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of the
        Terms, which shall continue to be in full force and effect.
        <br />
        <br />
        15. No Waiver
        <br />
        <br />
        The failure of the Company to require or enforce strict performance by
        the Purchaser of any provision of these Terms or the Company&rsquo;s
        failure to exercise any right under these Terms shall not be construed
        as a waiver or relinquishment of the Company's right to assert or rely
        upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance. The
        express waiver by the Company of any provision, condition, or
        requirement of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of any future
        obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement.
        Except as expressly and specifically set forth in these Terms, no
        representations, statements, consents, waivers, or other acts or
        omissions by the Denex Team shall be deemed a modification of these
        Terms nor be legally binding.
        <br />
        <br />
        16. Updates to the Terms
        <br />

        modify, add, or remove portions of the Terms at any time during the sale
        by posting the amended Terms on the Website. Any Purchaser will be
        deemed to have accepted such changes by purchasing DNX or holding DNX.
        The Terms may not be otherwise amended except by express consent of both
        the Purchaser and the Company.
        <br />
        <br />
        17. Cooperation with Legal Authorities
        <br />
        <br />
        The Company will cooperate with all law enforcement enquiries,

        <br />
        ANNEX A<br />
        DNX Risks
        <br />
        By purchasing, owning, and using DNX, you expressly acknowledge and
        assume the following risks:
        <br />
        <br />
        1. Risk of Losing Access to DNX Due to Loss of Private Key(s), Custodial
        Error or Purchaser Error
        <br />
        <br />A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to
        control and dispose of DNX stored in your digital wallet or vault.
        Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your
        digital wallet or vault storing DNX will result in loss of such DNX.
        Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s),
        including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet
        service you use, may be able to misappropriate your DNX. Any errors or
        malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital wallet or
        vault you choose to receive and store DNX in, including your own failure
        to properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, may also
        result in the loss of your DNX. Additionally, your failure to follow
        proper procedures for buying and selling ERC-20 tokens, including, for
        instance, if you provide the wrong address for the receiving DNX, or
        provide an address that is not ERC-20 compatible, may result in the loss
        of your Tokens.
        <br />
        <br />
        2. Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol
        <br />
        <br />
        Because DNX and the Denex platform are initially built on the Ethereum
        protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum
        protocol may have a material adverse effect on the platform or DNX.
        Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the
        development of quantum computing, could present risks to the DNX and the
        platform, including the utility of the DNX for obtaining services, by
        rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that
        underpins the Ethereum protocol.
        <br />
        <br />
        3. Risk of Mining Attacks
        <br />
        <br />
        As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the Ethereum
        protocol, DNX are susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of
        validating DNX transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, including, but
        not limited, to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and
        selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the
        platform and DNX, including, but not limited to, accurate execution and
        recording of transactions involving DNX.
        <br />
        <br />
        4. Risk of Hacking and Security Weaknesses
        <br />
        <br />
        Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to
        interfere with the platform or DNX in a variety of ways, including, but
        not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks,
        consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing, and spoofing.
        Furthermore, because the platform is based on open-source software,
        there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Company team may
        intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core
        infrastructure of the platform, which could negatively affect the
        platform and DNX, including the utility of DNX for obtaining services.
        <br />
        <br />
        5. Risks Associated with Markets for DNX
        <br />
        <br />
        If secondary trading of Tokens is facilitated by third party exchanges,
        such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no
        regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or
        manipulation. Furthermore, to the extent that third-parties do ascribe
        an external exchange value to DNX (e.g., as denominated in a digital or
        fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile.
        <br />
        <br />
        6. Risk of Uninsured Losses
        <br />
        <br />
        Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions,
        DNX are uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to
        insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there
        is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by Company, to offer
        recourse to you.
        <br />
        <br />
        7. Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions
        <br />
        <br />
        The regulatory status of DNX and distributed ledger technology is
        unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict
        how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with
        respect to such technology and its applications, including the Denex
        platform and DNX. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether
        legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and
        regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications,
        including the platform and DNX. Regulatory actions could negatively
        impact the platform and DNX in various ways, including, for purposes of
        illustration only, through a determination that the purchase, sale and
        delivery of DNX constitutes unlawful activity or that DNX are a
        regulated instrument that require registration or licensing of those
        instruments or some or all of the parties involved in the purchase, sale
        and delivery thereof. The Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction
        in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation,
        make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially
        undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in
        such jurisdiction.
        <br />
        <br />
        8. Risks Arising from Taxation
        <br />
        <br />
        The tax characterization of DNX is uncertain. You must seek your own tax
        advice in connection with purchasing DNX, which may result in adverse
        tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes, income taxes and
        tax reporting requirements.
        <br />
        <br />
        9. Risk of Competing platforms
        <br />
        <br />
        It is possible that alternative platforms could be established that
        utilize the same open source code and protocol underlying the platform
        and attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the
        Denex services.
        <br />
        <br />
        10. Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights
        <br />
        <br />
        Because DNX confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the
        Denex platform or the Company, all decisions involving the
        Company&rsquo;s products or services within the platform or the Company
        itself will be made by the Company at its sole discretion. These
        decisions could adversely affect the platform and the utility of any DNX
        you own, including their utility for obtaining services.
        <br />
        <br />
        11. Unanticipated Risks
        <br />
        <br />
        Cryptographic tokens such as DNX are a new and untested technology. In
        addition to the risks included in this Annex A of these Terms, there are
        other risks associated with your purchase, possession and use of DNX,
        including unanticipated risks. Such risks may further materialize as
        unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed in this
        Annex A of these Terms.

        <br />
        (1) &ldquo;U.S. Person&rdquo; means:
        <br />
        1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Any natural person resident in the United States;
        <br />
        2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Any partnership or corporation organized or
        incorporated under the laws of the United States;
        <br />
        3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Any estate of which any executor or administrator
        is a U.S. Person;
